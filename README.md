# Restaurant Application - "Bite Me"

This application was created in order to pass design classes in Web Applications Programming in the senior year of IT studies.
I used the PHP framework - Laravel.

After opening the page, we are greeted by a landing page, and when we scroll down, we can see an example of the "about us" and "reviews" sections.

The next tab is the menu, where we can see the currently offered dishes. New dishes can be added from the admin panel, which I will present below.

Then we go to the "reservations" tab, where we can make a reservation for a given week for a specific number of people and at a specific table.

At the end we see the "admin" tab, where we can log in to the panel.

Here, for example, the "menu" tab in the admin panel, where we can add, edit and delete dishes.

Let's make an example reservation and see that it will appear in the admin panel.

We will only be offered tables that are defined by the admin as available and have enough seats for the number of people we specify.

As we can see, the reservation has appeared.

The entire client-side application is fully responsive. The admin panel can also be operated on the phone, but I did not focus on it, because I decided that it should not be used in this way.
